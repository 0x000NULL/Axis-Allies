# Axis & Allies Global 1940 — Web Client

Interactive browser-based UI for the Axis & Allies game engine.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build WASM (from repo root)
./web/build.sh

# Serve locally
python3 web/serve.py
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

## Features

- **Interactive World Map** — Pan/zoom canvas with all 164 territories and 80 sea zones

## Architecture

- `index.html` — Main page structure
- `style.css` — Dark theme styling with power colors
- `app.js` — Main application (canvas rendering, game logic bridge, UI)
- `map-data.js` — Territory coordinates, power colors, unit data
- `pkg/` — WASM build output (generated by `build.sh`)

## Controls

- **Click & drag** — Pan the map
- **Scroll wheel** — Zoom in/out
- **Click territory** — Select and show info
- **End Phase** button — Advance to next phase
- **Undo** button — Undo last action

## Tech Stack

- Rust game engine compiled to WASM via `wasm-pack`
- Pure HTML5 Canvas rendering (no framework dependencies)
- ES modules for clean code organization
